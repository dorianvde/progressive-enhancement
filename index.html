<h2>The story</h2>
<div>
       <blockquote>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
       <p>They said, <i class="cita">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” </i>The farmer said, <i class="farmer"><strong>"Maybe."</strong></i></p>
       </blockquote> 
       <blockquote>
       <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <i class="cita">“Oh, isn’t that lucky.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
       <p>What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</i>” The farmer again said, <i class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong>”</i></p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
      <p>The neighbors then said, <i class="cita"> “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad </i></span>,” and the farmer responded, <i class="farmer"><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></i></p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
       <p>Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i class="cita"> "that great!” </i>, he said, <i class='farmer'><strong>Maybe.</strong></i>”</i></p>
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

    <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span>for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class ="good">good</span> bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
